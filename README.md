INTRO TO FUNCTIONS iN PYTHON
----------------------------

In Python there are calculations and logical operations that need to be performed repeatedly. 
Rather than writing the same code over and over and over again.. A better solution is to write a function.
Functions enable you to reuse logic an infinite number of times without repeating yourself
